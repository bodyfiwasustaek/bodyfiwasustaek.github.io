Check the fabric for any tears or holes. Repair them using appropriate fabric repair materials to maintain the canopy’s integrity. Seasonal Maintenance: At the end of the season, give your canopy a thorough cleaning and inspection. Make sure it’s completely dry before storing it away. Consider applying a water-repellent treatment to the fabric to enhance its weather resistance. Key Takeaways:\nProper setup and handling prevent damage.
